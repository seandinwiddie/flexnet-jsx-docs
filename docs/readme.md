# FlexNet Framework Documentation

A comprehensive documentation site for the FlexNet Framework - a functional JavaScript implementation for building modern web applications with zero dependencies.

## Overview

The FlexNet Framework is built entirely on **functional programming principles** with a focus on:

- **Pure Functions**: All application logic handled by functions without side effects
- **Immutable State**: State cannot be changed in place; new state is created through pure functions
- **Type Safety**: Built-in type system with `Maybe`, `Either`, and `Result` types
- **Effect Isolation**: Side effects are strictly isolated and managed by a dedicated Effect System
- **Zero Dependencies**: Self-contained framework with no external dependencies
- **Security First**: Built-in XSS prevention, input validation, and secure state management

## Framework Philosophy

FlexNet enforces a strict architectural pattern based on:

1. **Purity and Immutability**: All application logic uses pure functions with immutable state
2. **Explicit Side Effects**: External interactions are isolated in a dedicated Effect System
3. **Type Safety**: Built-in type system prevents runtime errors through `Maybe`, `Either`, and `Result` types
4. **Zero External Dependencies**: Complete self-containment with browser-native implementations
5. **Security First**: Built-in XSS prevention, secure state management, and input validation

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Follow the [Project Setup Guide](getting-started-guide/project-setup.html)
2. **Learn**: Read [Core Concepts](getting-started-guide/core-concepts.html)
3. **Build**: Use the [Project From Scratch Tutorial](reference-guides/project-from-scratch/)
4. **Reference**: Consult the [API Reference](api-reference/) as needed

## üéØ Event Coordination System

FlexNet includes a sophisticated event coordination system that enables better communication between UI components and centralized event management.

### Central Event Bus

The application uses a central event bus for coordinating interactions between components, themes, and application lifecycle events.

### Event Types

**Theme Events:**
- `THEME_CHANGE_REQUESTED` - Request theme change
- `THEME_CHANGED` - Theme has been applied

**Sidebar Events:**
- `SIDEBAR_TOGGLE_REQUESTED` - Request sidebar toggle
- `SIDEBAR_OPENED` - Sidebar section opened
- `SIDEBAR_CLOSED` - Sidebar section closed
- `SIDEBAR_SECTION_CLICKED` - Section clicked

**Component Events:**
- `COMPONENT_INITIALIZED` - Component setup complete
- `COMPONENT_ERROR` - Component setup failed
- `COPY_ACTION` - Copy button used

**App Lifecycle:**
- `APP_READY` - All components initialized
- `APP_ERROR` - Application error

### Component Coordination

Components automatically coordinate through the event system, enabling:
- Automatic theme propagation across all components
- Centralized sidebar state management
- Coordinated error handling and recovery
- Unified analytics and debugging capabilities

### Benefits

- **Decoupled Architecture** - Components don't directly depend on each other
- **Centralized Logging** - All events can be tracked and debugged
- **Coordinated UI Updates** - Theme changes, state updates propagate automatically
- **Better Testing** - Event-driven interactions are easier to test
- **Analytics Integration** - Event bus provides natural analytics hooks

## Core Architecture Highlights

### Project Structure
The framework follows a standardized directory structure:

```

### Type System

FlexNet provides three core types for safe programming:

- **`Maybe<T>`**: Handles optional values that might be missing
- **`Either<L, R>`**: Represents operations that can result in success (`Right`) or failure (`Left`)
- **`Result<T, E>`**: Represents the outcome of operations that might fail

### Security Features

- **XSS Prevention**: Automatic content sanitization and safe DOM manipulation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation functions for user inputs
- **Secure State Management**: Immutable state prevents accidental mutations
- **Effect Isolation**: Side effects are contained within the effect system

## Version Information

- **Framework Version**: 1.0.0
- **Documentation Version**: Latest
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-31
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

## Contributing

The FlexNet Framework follows strict functional programming principles. When contributing:

1. **Maintain Purity**: All functions should be pure with no side effects
2. **Use Type System**: Leverage Maybe, Either, and Result types appropriately
3. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to the development standards outlined in the documentation
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Include comprehensive tests for all functionality
5. **Document Clearly**: Provide clear documentation with examples

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Areas for Improvement**

1. **File Size**: `main.js` at 413 lines could be more modular
2. **Documentation**: Some utility functions extend beyond core documented API
3. **Complexity**: Effect system has many files (good modularity but complex)
