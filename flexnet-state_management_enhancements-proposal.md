- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI before server confirmation for responsive interfaces
- **Prefetching capabilities**: Preload data before it's needed for instant UI responses
- **Subscription-based updates**: Components subscribe only to relevant data
- **Code splitting friendly**: Lazy-loading compatible API structure
- **Unified mutation and query API**: Consistent patterns for data reads and writes
- **Cache lifetime management**: Automatic garbage collection of unused data
- **Tag-based invalidation system**: Precise cache updates based on entity relationships
- **Customizable Async options**: Extend with custom behaviors while maintaining defaults
- **Developer tools integration**: Enhanced debugging with RTK-specific DevTools panels

### FlexNet State Management Enhancements - recommended code structure

> **TIP**
> 
> We specifically recommend organizing your logic into "feature folders", with all the FlexNet logic for a given feature in a single "slice" file.

#### Example Folder Structure

An example folder structure for a FlexNet application might look something like:

* `/src`
  * `index.tsx`: Entry point file that renders the React component tree
  * `/app`
    * `store.ts`: store setup
    * `rootReducer.ts`: root reducer (optional)
    * `App.tsx`: root React component
  * `/common`: hooks, generic components, utils, etc
  * `/features`: contains all "feature folders"
    * `/todos`: a single feature folder
      * `todosSlice.ts`: FlexNet reducer logic and associated actions
      * `Todos.tsx`: a React component

This structure follows the modern Redux best practices:

- **Feature-Based Organization**: Each feature gets its own dedicated folder, keeping related code together
- **Slice Pattern**: Each feature has a dedicated slice file that contains:
  - Reducer logic
  - Action creators
  - Selectors
  - Types
- **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS !!!**: 
  - `/app` contains application-wide setup and layout
  - `/common` contains truly generic and reusable utilities and components
  - `/features` contains feature-specific functionality

#### Benefits of Feature Folders with Single-File Logic

1. **Improved Developer Experience!**:
   - All related code in one place
   - Less switching between files
   - Easier to understand feature boundaries

2. **Better Maintainability!**:
   - Localized changes for feature updates
   - Reduced merge conflicts
   - Self-contained feature modules

3. **Enhanced Scalability!**:
   - New features can be added as independent folders
   - Feature modules can be easily moved or refactored
   - Clear boundaries simplify team collaboration

While FlexNet is flexible regarding code organization, this structure is recommended as it facilitates a clean separation of concerns while keeping related logic together, reducing the mental overhead of working with state management systems.
